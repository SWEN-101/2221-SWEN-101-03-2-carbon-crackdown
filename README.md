# Project Name: Carbon Crackdown

Here at Carbon Crackdown, our goals are to bring awareness to how much pollution the wealthy are responsible for. Although we believe every individual should do what they can to assist the environment, we also believe the wealthy are responsible for significantly more pollution, yet average people are the ones held responsible and told to “reduce, reuse, recycle.” We envision a society where all citizens are well-informed of the consequences that our actions may have on the environment, and this starts at the top.
 
We hope to create a website called “Carbon Crackdown” — a website that tracks the private flight patterns of celebrities and calculates their carbon footprint compared to the average person. These flight patterns are public knowledge, our website would specifically focus on celebrities to help highlight the disparity in environmental impact between the wealthy and average people. Our website would be available to everyone, with daily updates as we receive them. With this website you may also compare your own carbon footprint to those of famous celebrities, and learn how to advocate against their indulgent habits with protests and boycotts. All profits (generated through advertising) will go towards a conservation effort chosen monthly by the users via a poll.
